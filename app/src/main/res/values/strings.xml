        works, I wonder how it will format this, if it takes the new line from the new line
        I manually enter or it will add new lines as needed. Anyway I saw the movie
        Little Miss Sunshine tonight before working on this. It was pretty good. Feel good,
        but at the same time every character has their own tragedy and makes them kinda fucked
        up but that's what gives characters character you know what I mean? In other news I'm
        having a blast playing leagues III on runescape. Im gonna hate having to go back to my
        main account and grind out hours just for a level, but it has also invigorated me
        and given me goals for ym account. Uh oh there goes a double and in a sentence. My fiancee
        would roast my writing if she saw that."</string>
